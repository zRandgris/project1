# Title : Consumer Spending Habits/Trend

Note: This data set uses chain-weighted CPI
-   Chain-weighted CPI takes real-word purchasing decisions into account to provide a more accurate picture of the cost of living.
-   Chain-weighted CPI can capture both general changes in spending, as consumer preferences change, and substitution effects, when relative prices change.
-   The adjustments in chain-weighted CPI make it a better measure of the cost of living, but a less accurate measure of inflation.
What Is Chain-Weighted CPI?
Chain-weighted CPI, or chained CPI, is an alternative measurement for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that considers changes to consumer spending patterns to provide a more accurate picture of the cost of living based on the goods that consumers actually buy.



# Things to take note of

Transport: During covid, we can see a significant drop in expenses.
    People were staying home isolating, and working from home. Even after 
    covid, the transport expense did not go back to the previous level.

    A lot of people are probrably still working from home.

Net Expenditure : Negative during and after covid, people are restricted from traveling/investment.

Health(Medical products, Services): intresting to see that health expenses are constant during covid, i guess we can thank the canadian health care.

Household equiptment: We can see a slight surge right after covid. As people working from home or spending more time at home,
people started to buy more furnitures.

Food, services: People can't eat out, hence the decrease.

Food, cooking : People spend more at home cooking, as it is a necessity, expenses not spend on food service moved to at home cooking.

Clothings people do not go shopping, or no much need buying new cloth when staying home.

Alcoholic beverages: did not go down during covid, it even went up! People rely on substances during hard times.


Categories that did not change much during covid!
So ... > catergories that are not prone to a pendemic.

-   Insurance and financial services
-   Housing Utilities
-   Communications
-   Eudcation
-   Substances

So  i was extra interested in education.
during covid we see a slight decrease, it was not as much as i thought it did!

Regression-overall
- R-Value of 0.8573
- Clearly an upward trend
- High R-Value = Meaning the years are correlated with expenses.
- And we can see, the expenditure after covid is catching up to the previous trend.


Hypothesis
-   Null Hypothesisâ€” Consumer spending habit stayed the same.
-   Alternative Hypothesis-- Consumer spending habit changed after covid.

P-Value = 0.147688
P-Value > 0.05
We have failed to reject the Null Hypothesis.

Limitation: Covid happened too recent, hard to have large data set to perform statistical analysis.
