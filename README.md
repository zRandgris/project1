Transport: During covid, we can see a significant drop in expenses.
People were staying home isolating, and working from home. Even after 
covid, the transport expense did not go back to the previous level.

A lot of people are probrably still working from home.

Net Expenditure : Negative during and after covid, people are restricted from traveling.

Health: intresting to see that health expenses are constant during covid, i guess we can thank the canadian health care.

Household equiptment: We can see a slight surge right after covid. As people working from home or spending more time at home,
people started to buy more furnitures.

Food, services: People can't eat out, hence the decrease.

Food, cooking : People spend more at home cooking, as it is a necessity, expenses not spend on food service moved to at home cooking.

Clothings people do not go shopping, or no much need buying new cloth when staying home.

Alcoholic beverages: did not go down during covid, it even went up! People rely on substances during hard times.
